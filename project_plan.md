# UN Parallel Corpora Analysis Project Plan 

## Summary
I want to analyze all data of the UN's cross translated documents to further study how different languages can say the same things in differnet lengths/structures.

## DATA Porrtion
XML Files on th UN's website. Corpora of articles published and each paralell text in the other UN offical languages.

## Analysis
Word length, Sentence length, Hapaxes, TTR, etc. How does each language say the same thing but differently, as well as what remains the same? What can't change abou langauge. Is that close to semanticity?

## Presentation
UN color scheme, Pandas charts, texts from several articles (english translations when not an english-L2 file.)
