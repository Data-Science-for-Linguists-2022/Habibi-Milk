## Introduction
For my term project in Na-Rae Han's Data Science for Linguists class at the University of Pittsburgh, I chose to use the [United Nations' Sixway Parallel Corpus](https://conferences.unite.un.org/uncorpus).

## Data Sourcing and Explanation
This corpus was sourced from the [UN website](https://conferences.unite.un.org/uncorpus). The UN Parallel Corpus is composed of official parliamentary documents, records, and other documents within the public domain that are available in the six official languages of the UN. Those languages are: English, Spanish, French, Russian, Mandarin Chinese, and Arabic.
