## Introduction
For my term project in Na-Rae Han's Data Science for Linguists class at the University of Pittsburgh, I chose to use the [United Nations' Sixway Parallel Corpus](https://conferences.unite.un.org/uncorpus).

## Data Sourcing and Explanation
This corpus was sourced from the [UN website](https://conferences.unite.un.org/uncorpus). The UN Parallel Corpus is composed of official parliamentary documents, records, and other documents within the public domain that are available in the six official languages of the UN. Those languages are: English, Spanish, French, Russian, Mandarin Chinese, and Arabic. The current version as of May 1st 2022 contains documents created and manually translated between 1990 and 2014. 

The files were downloaded from the source. It states on the website that each document was in `XML` file format with embedded meta-information of the **Symbol** of the official UN document, it's **translation job number**, the **publication date**, the **processing location**, and the **keyword** which determined the document subject.
